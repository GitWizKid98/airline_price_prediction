# FLIGHT PRICE PREDICTION

Heroku app link -  https://flightpricepredictionapp.herokuapp.com/

# PROJECT GOAL

### This project is designed to predict the FLIGHT TRAVEL PRICE using Regression Analysis with Python, FLASK, HTML, SQL

### A highly comprehensive analysis with all data cleaning, exploration, visualization, feature selection, model building, evaluation and MLR assumptions validity steps explained in detail.

# The Python file has following sections:

**1- Data Preprocessing and some Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data**

**2- Data preparation: Feature Engineering and Scaling**

**3- Feature Selection using using Lasso and Ridge and Model Building**

**4- Regression Assumptions Validation and Outlier Removal**

**5- Rebuilding the Model Post Outlier Removal: Feature Selection using Lasso and Ridge**

**6- Removing Multicollinearity, Model Re-evaluation and Assumptions Validation**
